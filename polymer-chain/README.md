# **Polymer Chain (Bead-Spring) Simulation**

This folder contains a Python simulation of a **polymer chain** using a **bead-spring model**. The simulation models how connected beads (monomers) undergo **Brownian motion**, allowing the chain to fluctuate and display key polymer properties.

---

## **Overview**

The polymer is modeled as **N beads connected by harmonic springs**:

- Each bead represents a monomer  
- Harmonic springs maintain bond lengths approximately at `r0`  
- Thermal noise is applied as **Brownian motion**  

Key polymer properties are computed:

- **End-to-End distance (`Re`)**  
- **Radius of Gyration (`Rg`)**  

Interactive sliders allow adjustment of **N, k (spring stiffness), and D (noise strength)**.

## **Features**

- 2D polymer chain simulation  
- **Interactive sliders** for N, k, D  
- **Real-time animation** of bead positions  
- **Live computation** of `Re` and `Rg`  
- Optional saving of animations as **MP4** or **GIF**

## **Requirements**

- Python 3.x  
- Packages:
  - `numpy`
  - `matplotlib`
  - `pillow` (optional, for saving GIFs)
